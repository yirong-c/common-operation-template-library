# [Common Operation Template Library (COTL)](https://github.com/yirong-c/common-operation-template-library)

Common Operation Template Library (COTL) includes 
some augmented data structures and algorithms
in a style similar to STL.

## Contents

### [Partition](https://github.com/yirong-c/common-operation-template-library/blob/dev/include/partition.hpp)

- partition around pivot and return the range of elements that are eqaul to the pivot value

## Application

COTL is widely used in [yirong-c/CLRS](https://github.com/yirong-c/CLRS),
which includes

- C++ code implementation of data structures and algorithms

- exercise and problem solutions of "Introduction to Algorithms" (CLRS) 3rd edition
